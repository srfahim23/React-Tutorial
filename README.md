How does React Work ? 

React Creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory.

Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM 
in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the 
changes in the the browser DOM.

React only changes what needs to be changed !

React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs 
to be changed.
